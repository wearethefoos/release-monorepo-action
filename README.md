# Release Action

A GitHub Action that creates SemVer releases based on conventional commits. This
action analyzes commit messages to determine version bumps and creates releases
accordingly.

## Features

- Automatically determines version bumps based on conventional commit messages
- Supports prereleases from pull requests
- Creates GitHub releases with changelogs
- Updates package versions in manifest files
- Handles multiple packages in a monorepo setup
- Tag pull requests to create prereleases

## Manifest File Format

The manifest file should be a JSON file that lists all possible packages to
release in the format:

```json
{
  "path/to/package": {
    "latest": "1.0.0",
    "main": "0.9.33",
    "canary": "1.0.0"
  },
  "another/package": {
    "latest": "1.1.0",
    "main": "1.1.0"
  }
}
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```yaml
name: Release

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]

jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0

      - uses: wearethefoos/release-action@v1
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

### With Prereleases

```yaml
name: Release

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]

jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0

      - uses: wearethefoos/release-action@v1
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          create-prereleases: true
          # Add this label to a PR to create prereleases for it
          prerelease-label: 'Prerelease'
```

## How It Works

1. The action checks if it's running on a pull request or the main branch
1. For merges / commits to main:
   - It gathers commit info to determine the version bump (see below)
   - It creates a release PR with the changes to the package versions,
     changelogs, and manifest.
   - If the merge / commit was from a release PR, it creates releases and
     outputs the versioning info.
1. For pull requests:
   - If `create-prereleases` is false, it exits
   - If the PR is tagged with the prerelease label, it creates a prerelease and
     outputs the versioning info.
1. For each package in the manifest:
   - Gathers commits since the last merge to main
   - Parses conventional commit messages
   - Determines version bump based on commit types
   - Generates changelog
1. Creates a release with:
   - Updated package versions
   - Generated changelog
   - GitHub release and tags

## Conventional Commit Types

The action supports the following conventional commit types:

- `feat`: Minor version bump
- `fix`: Patch version bump
- `docs`: No version bump
- `style`: No version bump
- `refactor`: Patch version bump
- `perf`: Patch version bump
- `test`: No version bump
- `chore`: No version bump
- `revert`: Patch version bump
- `ci`: No version bump
- `build`: No version bump

Breaking changes (indicated by `!` in the commit message) will trigger a major
version bump.
